PySegCNN: Image segmentation with convolutional neural networks in Python
=========================================================================

``pysegcnn`` is a Python package to build deep fully convolutional neural
networks for semantic image segmentation. The package is primarily designed to
work with multispectral satellite imagery. ``pysegcnn`` is based on the machine
learning framework `PyTorch <https://pytorch.org/>`_.
